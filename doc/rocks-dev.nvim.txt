SUMMARY                                               *rocks-dev.nvim-summary*

`rocks-dev.nvim` extends `rocks.nvim`
<https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim> with the ability to install dev
plugins locally.


INSTALLATION                                     *rocks-dev.nvim-installation*

Simply run `:Rocks install rocks-dev.nvim`, and you are good to go!


USAGE                                                   *rocks-dev.nvim-usage*

With this extension, you can add a `dir` field table to plugins in your
`rocks.toml`, for example:

>toml
    [plugins."sweetie.nvim"]
    dir = "~/git/nvim/sweetie.nvim"
<

This extension also supports `dev.path`, which allows you to provide the path
to where local plugins are stored. You can tell rocks-dev to load a plugin from
that path with `dev = true`, for example:

>toml
    [dev]
    path = "~/Projects"
    
    [plugins]
    "sweetie.nvim" = { dev = true }
<

When both `dir` and `dev = true` are present, `dir` gets priority.


ROCKS-CONFIG INTEROPERABILITY   *rocks-dev.nvim-rocks-config-interoperability*

You can use `rocks-config.nvim >= 2.0.0`
<https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim> to configure `dev`
plugins, however, it does not currently work with bundles
<https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#plugin-bundles>.
